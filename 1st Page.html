<p style="text-align:left"> 
The world is a big place. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">It is bigger than you think it is.</p>

<p style="text-align:right">You think you know how big it is.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">But the problem is you're gonna die without even being able to know exactly how big it is.</p>

<p>justify: This is fifth Paragraph.</p>

<p>That's why, don't care about the world.  
<br>Be happy with what you have and do what you can do.
<br>Then your life will be happy.</p>
